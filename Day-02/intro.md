- It is not possible to login without using AUTHENTICATION.
- THEIR ARE 2 WAYS TO AUTHENTICATE
- 1. PASSWORD
- 2. SSH KEYS (PUBLIC KEY, PRIVATE KEY) - PUBLIC KEY IS SET UP IN TARGET VM, -- AND USING PRIVATE KEY WE CAN TALK TO THEM.

NOTE : WHEN WE TRY TO CONNECT TO THE VM, It will ask for SSH KEY PEM FILE OR PASSWORD.
